She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.,MEDICATIONS: , Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known medicine allergies.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78.,HEENT:  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,Lungs:  Clear.,ASSESSMENT:,  Allergic rhinitis.,PLAN:,1.  She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again.  Another option will be to use loratadine.  She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.,2.  Samples of Nasonex two sprays in each nostril given for three weeks.  A prescription was written as well.

The left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness appear normal.  The wall motion and left ventricular systolic function appears hyperdynamic with estimated ejection fraction of 70% to 75%.  There is near-cavity obliteration seen.  There also appears to be increased left ventricular outflow tract gradient at the mid cavity level consistent with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.  There is abnormal left ventricular relaxation pattern seen as well as elevated left atrial pressures seen by Doppler examination.,2.  The left atrium appears mildly dilated.,3.  The right atrium and right ventricle appear normal.,4.  The aortic root appears normal.,5.  The aortic valve appears calcified with mild aortic valve stenosis, calculated aortic valve area is 1.3 cm square with a maximum instantaneous gradient of 34 and a mean gradient of 19 mm.,6.  There is mitral annular calcification extending to leaflets and supportive structures with thickening of mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation.,7.  The tricuspid valve appears normal with trace tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.  Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 49 mmHg.  Estimated right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg.,8.  The pulmonary valve appears normal with trace pulmonary insufficiency.,9.  There is no pericardial effusion or intracardiac mass seen.,10.  There is a color Doppler suggestive of a patent foramen ovale with lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.,11.  The study was somewhat technically limited and hence subtle abnormalities could be missed from the study.,
